# Learnings — ipod-sync

Per global CLAUDE.md: record discovered conventions, gotchas, debugging insights, and useful commands here as work proceeds. One bullet per learning.

## Phase 0

- **bindgen + libclang on Windows (Task 5):** VS18 Community ships `clang-format.exe` and `clang-tidy.exe` under `VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin` but does NOT include `clang.exe` or `libclang.dll`. bindgen 0.72 needs `libclang.dll` to parse C headers. Install the full LLVM toolchain via `winget install --id LLVM.LLVM` (drops it at `C:\Program Files\LLVM\`). Either add `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin` to `PATH` or set `LIBCLANG_PATH=C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin` for cargo.
- **bindgen needs GLib include paths (Task 5):** `vendor/libgpod/include/gpod/itdb.h` includes `<glib.h>` and `<glib-object.h>`. Those live under `C:/msys64/mingw64/include/glib-2.0` and `C:/msys64/mingw64/lib/glib-2.0/include` (the second has `glibconfig.h`). `build.rs` adds both via `.clang_arg("-I...")`. Without these bindgen errors out on the very first include.
- **bindgen 0.72 allowlist for the spike (Task 5):** Allowlist `itdb_.*`, `Itdb_.*`, `ITDB_.*`, `g_error_.*`, `GError`, `GList`. `GError` and `g_error_*` are pre-added so Task 6 doesn't have to revisit `build.rs`. `GList` is needed for walking the track list in Task 6.
- **`Itdb_Track` type name (Task 5):** bindgen 0.72 generates `Itdb_Track` (matching the C typedef) directly under the `ffi` module — no mangling. `size_of::<ffi::Itdb_Track>()` on x86_64-pc-windows-msvc with this libgpod build = **640 bytes**.
- **build.rs DLL copy is load-bearing for `cargo run`:** Without copying `vendor/libgpod/bin/*.dll` into `target/<profile>/` at build time, `cargo run` fails immediately with "gpod.dll was not found". The current `build.rs` copies the full closure (16 DLLs: gpod.dll + 15 MinGW/GLib runtime DLLs).

## libgpod acquisition research (2026-05-17)

### Searches conducted

- **MSYS2**: Not found — `packages.msys2.org/search?q=libgpod` returned zero results as of 2026-05-16. No `mingw-w64-x86_64-libgpod`, `mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libgpod`, or any variant exists in the MSYS2 package database. Confirmed by checking the MSYS2 GitHub repo `msys2/MINGW-packages` via `gh api` search (no results).
- **gtkpod SourceForge**: Last libgpod source release is v0.8.3 in the `libgpod-0.8` folder (folder last modified 2013-09-04). No Windows binaries, DLLs, or installers found in any subfolder (`libgpod-0.8`, `libgpod-unstable`, `libgpod-0.7.9x`, `libgpod-0.7.2`, `libgpod-0.7.0`, `libgpod-0.6.0`). The `libgpod` root was last touched 2011-01-03.
- **GitHub (fadingred/libgpod and forks)**: `fadingred/libgpod` — no Releases, no Windows artifacts, Unix autotools only. `gtkpod/libgpod` — no Releases published. `strawberrymusicplayer/strawberry-libgpod` — has a CMakeLists.txt (added 2021-08-19) but no Releases, no Windows binaries. The CMakeLists.txt uses GCC-only flags (`-std=c99`, `-Wall`, `-Wmissing-declarations`, etc.) that are incompatible with MSVC cl.exe. `jburton/libgpod`, `hyperair/libgpod`, `gerion0/libgpod` — no Windows artifacts in any.
- **vcpkg port**: Does **not exist** — confirmed via `gh api repos/microsoft/vcpkg/contents/ports` search and `vcpkg.io/en/packages.html?query=libgpod` (no results). There is no `libgpod` port in the vcpkg curated registry as of May 2026 (2807 total ports).
- **Strawberry MSVC build chain**: `strawberrymusicplayer/strawberry-msvc-build-tools` explicitly sets `-DENABLE_GPOD=OFF` in both debug and release CMake configurations. The `strawberry-msvc-dependencies` releases (most recent: tag 3520, 2026-05-16) contain no libgpod. This is the most active Windows MSVC music-player dependency chain and it deliberately excludes libgpod.
- **Forum / contributor builds**: Strawberry forum thread about libgpod+iPod on Windows discussed only macOS/Linux. No Hydrogenaudio or other community contributor with a known-working Windows MSVC libgpod recipe found via web search for 2022–2026.

### Candidates considered

- `strawberrymusicplayer/strawberry-libgpod` (CMake fork, last commit 2021-08-19): Has a CMakeLists.txt that could theoretically be built on Windows, but uses GCC-only compiler flags, requires GLib/GModule/GObject/libplist/SQLite/zlib all pre-built for MSVC, and has never been released as a Windows binary. Would require patching the CMakeLists.txt and sourcing all transitive MSVC deps. Not viable as a prebuilt.
- Any MSYS2 MinGW build (hypothetical): Even if one were built, it would link against the MinGW runtime, not UCRT/MSVC CRT, making it incompatible for use from an MSVC-compiled Rust binary without a very careful ABI boundary analysis.
- Building from source with autotools + MSYS2/MinGW cross-toolchain: Possible but produces MinGW-linked DLLs, which introduce runtime mismatch risk with `cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.

### Decision: Branch B — Build from source

- **Reason:** No prebuilt libgpod for Windows x64 exists anywhere (MSYS2, SourceForge, GitHub Releases, vcpkg) as of May 2026; even the most active Windows MSVC music-player project (Strawberry) explicitly disables libgpod support on Windows.
- **Next action:** Proceed to Task 4 — build from source. The recommended path is to use the `strawberrymusicplayer/strawberry-libgpod` CMake fork as the source base (it has already eliminated the autotools dependency), patch the CMakeLists.txt to replace GCC-only flags with MSVC-compatible equivalents, and hand-build its transitive dependencies (GLib, libplist, SQLite, zlib) either via vcpkg (all four are available vcpkg ports) or the strawberry-msvc-dependencies tarball. There is no vcpkg port for libgpod itself, so a custom CMake build step in the repo (vendored under `vendor/libgpod/`) is the cleanest path.
